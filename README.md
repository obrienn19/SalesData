# SalesData

Hi,
The important things to read are the .csv files given and the Quarterly500df2 python file. The other ones are the failed python codes so just read those. Quarterly500df2
should have all the correct code to run, assuming you have the correct environmental tools (pandas, tf, keras, etc) and all the data downloads in the .py file are already
in the same directory. If you have problems importing the .csv, check your working directory and make sure it matches

Happy netting :)
